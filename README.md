#Projects:
---
## AWS based Smart classroom assistant for educators.
‚óè Implemented an end-to-end scalable solution for image recognition using multiple IaaS services of AWS.
‚óè Developed automatic scaling of the application to handle increasing demand by using no more than 20 EC2 instances and queuing pending requests
using Simple Queue Service (SQS) , with inputs and outputs stored in separate S3 buckets for persistence.
‚óè Optimized implementation to meet the target performance to handle the peak load and was able to handle more than 5000 multithreaded requests.
‚óè Added additional functionality using AWS Lambda which can automatically scale out and in on demand.
‚óè Developed the algorithm that performs face recognition on videos, looks up recognized students in DynamoDB, and returns their academic
information as a csv file.
‚óè Utilized Docker containers to create a customized Lambda function for video processing and face recognition resulting in a highly efficient
application that can process more than 1000 requests in less than 7 minutes.
## Stock trading system Fall 2022
‚óè Developed a stock trading platform that allows users to trade stocks. The platform caters to two distinct user types: Administrators and Customers.
‚óè Created multiple API‚Äôs using java to buy stock, sell stock, create stock, placing market and limit orders and used MariaDb as the database.
‚óè Developed the front end using React.Js and used Redux for state management so that when multiple users login to their account they can view their
own portfolio.
‚óè Implemented a random stock price generator using python that dynamically fluctuates prices throughout the day to enhance the realism of a stock
trading platform by sending continuous POST requests to the sever.
## Mental health treatment predictor using data mining.
‚óè Classified whether or not an employee needed treatment based on the mental health in tech survey data.
‚óè Preprocessed and cleaned the obtained data in order to apply classification algorithms.
‚óè Implemented variety of machine learning classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random forest, Support
‚óè vector machine, Decision tree, K nearest neighbor, Recurrent neural network, Adaboost.
‚óè After comparing these classifiers using performing metrics such as Accuracy,F-1 score ,precision and recall achieved the best classification accuracy
of 84% for support vector machine .
